 @discussion Some activities require application-specific credentials. Since `OSKActivitiesManager`
 cannot create them on its own, these credentials must be vended to it via this method. 
 
 The following built-in services require application credentials:
 
 - App.net
 - Readability
 - Pocket
 
 The setup documents for Overshare discuss each case in detail.
