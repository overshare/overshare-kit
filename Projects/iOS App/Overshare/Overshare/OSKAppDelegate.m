     Branch enables custom downloads for every new user.
     Drive higher conversions and more engagement using deep links that pass data through install and open.
     
     1. Track how many installs/opens come from each shared link.
     2. Calculate viral kFactor
     3. Insight into which share channels are driving the most downloads: Facebook, Twitter, etc.
     4. Insight and analytics on which users are you rbiggest influencers and driving the most downloads.
     5. Embed custom dictionaries that live on through clicking a link - even through the app store - to build a customized experience for each new user and make it really easy to deep link.
     6. Customize links with OG tags to display content in Facebook, Twitter, etc.
     7. Reward new or reffering users! Power the link with referral tracking, reward attribution, and credit balance!

You will also want to implement this method whent he user signs up or authenticates into your app.
